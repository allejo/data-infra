# Contribute
## Commits and Pull Requests (PR)

* Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for all commits
* Use Conventional Commit format for PR titles
* Use GitHub's *draft* status to indicate PRs that are not ready for review/merging
* Do not use GitHub's "update branch" button or merge the `main` branch back into a PR branch to update it. Instead, rebase PR branches to update them and resolve any merge conflicts.
