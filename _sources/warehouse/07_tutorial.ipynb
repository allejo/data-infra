    "# Tutorial - Querying the CALITP Data Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following content represents a tutorial introduction to simple queries that can be made to the calitp data warehouse, and the methods that can be used to perform them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries represented in the following tutorial are as follows:\n",
    "* **Number of Routes for a Given Agency Over Time** - observing a change in route numbers per agency across time\n",
    "* **Number of Stops for a Given Agency Over Time**\n",
    "* **Number of Stops Made Across all Trips for an Agency**\n",
    "* **For a Given Agency, on Each Day, Days Until the Feed Expires**\n",
    "* **Max Number of Stops a Trip Can Have, Per Agency**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools that we can use to answer them are:\n",
    "* **SQL** - Using the BigQuery Browser\n",
    "* **Python**\n",
    "    * *siuba* - a convenient data analysis library in Python\n",
    "    * *calitp* - a personalized package incorporating calitp's unique needs\n",
    "    * *pandas* - a useful data analysis library, used sparsely in the examples below\n",
    "* **Metabase** - our business insights visualization tool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fact Tables\n",
    "These tables contain measurements, metrics, and facts used to answer the questions from the following perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feeds**\n",
    "* views.**gtfs_schedule_fact_daily_feeds**\n",

    "    * (**Gtfs Schedule Data Feed Trip Stops Latest** in Metabase)\n",

    "These tables compliment the fact tables by providing additional descriptive attributes:\n",
