## Introduction to JupyterHub
For Python users, we have deployed a cloud-based instance of JupyterHub to creating, using, and sharing notebooks easy.

This avoids the need to set up a local environment, provides dedicated storage, and allows you to push to GitHub.

**You can access JuypterHub [using this link](https://hubtest.k8s.calitp.jarv.us/)**.

## Using JupyterHub
Jupyterhub is a web application that allows users to analyze and create reports on warehouse data (or a number of data sources).

Analyses on jupyterhub are done using notebooks, which allow users to mix narrative with analysis code.

### Logging in to JupyterHub

JupyterHub currently lives at https://hubtest.k8s.calitp.jarv.us/hub/. In order to be added to the Cal-ITP JupyterHub, please [open an issue using this link](https://github.com/cal-itp/data-infra/issues/new?assignees=charlie-costanzo&labels=new+team+member&template=new-team-member.md&title=New+Team+Member+-+%5BName%5D).

### Connecting to the Warehouse

Connecting to the warehouse requires a bit of setup after logging in to JupyterHub.
Users need to download and install the gcloud commandline tool from the app.

```python
# initial setup (in terminal) ----
curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-361.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf google-cloud-sdk-361.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init

# log in to project ----
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

See the screencast below for a full walkthrough.

### Uploading Data

Currently, report data can be stored in the `calitp-analytics-data` bucket.

In order to save data being used in a report, you can use two methods:

* Using code in your notebook to upload the data.
* Using the google cloud storage web UI to manually upload.

These are demonstrated in the screencast below.

#### Uploading data from a notebook

The code below shows how to copy a file from JupyterHub to the data bucket.
Be sure to replace `<FILE NAME>` and `<ANALYSIS FOLDER>` with the appropriate names.

For additional details, including options for reading/writing geospatial data using `geopandas`, see [](storing-new-data).

```python
# Using the `calitp` package
from calitp.storage import get_fs

fs = get_fs()

fs.put("<FILE NAME>", "gs://calitp-analytics-data/data-analyses/<ANALYSIS FOLDER>/<FILE NAME>")

# Using the `gcsfs` package
import gcsfs
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd

# CSV
df = pd.read_csv("gs://calitp-analytics-data/data-analyses/<ANALYSIS FOLDER>/<FILE NAME>")
df.to_csv("gs://calitp-analytics-data/data-analyses/<ANALYSIS FOLDER>/<FILE NAME>")

# Parquet
df = pd.read_parquet("gs://calitp-analytics-data/data-analyses/<ANALYSIS FOLDER>/<FILE NAME>")
df.to_parquet("gs://calitp-analytics-data/data-analyses/<ANALYSIS FOLDER>/<FILE NAME>")
```

#### Uploading from google cloud storage

You can access the cloud bucket from the web from https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/calitp-analytics-data.

See the above screencast for a walkthrough of using the bucket.

### Environment Variables

Sometimes if data access is expensive, or if there is sensitive data, then accessing it will require some sort of credentials (which may take the form of passwords or tokens).

There is a fundamental tension between data access restrictions and analysis reproducibility. If credentials are required, then an analysis is not reproducible out-of-the-box. However, including these credentials in scripts and notebooks is a security risk.

Most projects should store the authentication credentials in environment variables, which can then be read by scripts and notebooks. The environment variables that are required for an analysis to work should be clearly documented.

Analysts should store their credentials in a `_env` file, a slight variation of the typical `.env` file, since the `.env` won't show up in the JupyterHub filesystem.

Some credentials that need to be stored within the `_env` file may include GitHub API key, Census API key, Airtable API key, etc. Store them in this format:

```python
GITHUB_API_KEY=ABCDEFG123456789
CENSUS_API_KEY=ABCDEFG123456789
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=ABCDEFG123456789
```

To pass these credentials in a Jupyter Notebook:
```python
import dotenv
import os

# Load the env file
dotenv.load_dotenv("_env")

# Import the credential (without exposing the password!)
GITHUB_API_KEY = os.environ["GITHUB_API_KEY"]
```
